NETWORKING NEEDED FOR SOCKETS(sockets are all networking)
TCP:
* When using the internet, the way that data is being transfered across
  multiple computers on a network is through "packets".

  - packets: (data partition sent through the internet)

    * there are 5 layers to a packet.
      1. Application(HTTP/FTP/SMTP/SSH - protocols most familiar to developers)
      2. Transport:
         - UDP: User Datagram Protocol
           * lightweight (only 8 bytes per header)
           * connectionless (when there is communication between a 
             client and a server, UDP can send data directly without establiching
             a connection)
           * UDP will send data no matter what. Whether there are dropped packets,
             packets are out of order. It is VERY fast, but VERY unreliable
           * used for things like video games, and/or real time communication. 
         - TCP: responsible for access to ports. Creates ports on
                a computer up to (2^16) 65,000 ports available to use
            * 
      3. network(IP - Internet Protocol)
      4. Link(WiFi or ethernet connection)
      5. Physical(cables that are connecting things together)
